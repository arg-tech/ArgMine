Nospeaker: Ordered,That Alex Cunningham be discharged from the Environmental Audit Committee and Ruth Jones be added.—(Bill Wiggin, on behalf of the Selection Committee.)

David Linden: On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. It has just been revealed to me in an e mail that Clydesdale Bank plans to shut its Shettleston Road branch, which is in my constituency.  Can you advise me what opportunities might be available to me, as a constituency Member, to place on record that people in Shettleston will not stand for this closure, and that we will fight it every step of the way?

Eleanor Laing: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. He has asked me a question to which I can give a very direct answer. If he wishes to draw this important matter—and I appreciate how important it is in his constituency—to the attention of the House and of the appropriate Minister, there are various ways in which he can do so. I am sure that he will receive good advice from the Table Office, and I am sure that we shall hear more of this matter in the coming days.
