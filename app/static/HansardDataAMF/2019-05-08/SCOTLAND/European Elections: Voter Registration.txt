Martin Whitfield: What assessment he has made of the adequacy of arrangements for voter registration for the forthcoming European parliamentary elections in Scotland. 

David Mundell: I am content that the arrangements are robust. The UK Government have worked to ensure that the “register to vote” website, which has been running since 2014, is secure against malicious attacks and robust enough to manage traffic in line with registration deadlines.

Martin Whitfield: If it is robust enough, how come only 288 of the 2,000 non UK EU citizens in East Lothian have managed to register? Is that really the foundation of the Secretary of State’s democracy?

David Mundell: If the hon. Gentleman can bring forward details of any citizens who have tried to register but not succeeded in doing so, I will obviously look at that. There have been many campaigns to encourage people to register, and I particularly commend the Daily Record newspaper for its efforts in that regard.

Ian Murray: The Secretary of State is a big advocate of the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal. If he has such great confidence in that deal, why does he not have confidence in the people and allow them to decide whether it is a deal that they want?

David Mundell: The people of Scotland made their decision in 2014; the people of the United Kingdom made their decision in 2016.
