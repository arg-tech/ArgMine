Daniel Zeichner: Whether he plans to meet representatives of the Environment Agency to discuss the recent pay dispute at that agency. 

Therese Coffey: No.

Daniel Zeichner: That is very disappointing to hear. We have just heard praise for the Environment Agency, but its staff have seen a 20% cut in real terms over the past decade. The agency is suffering from recruitment and retention problems and, inevitably, low morale. Will the Minister think again and at least press the Environment Agency to reopen the discussions?

Therese Coffey: No, because it is an operational matter for the Environment Agency and it would not be appropriate for the Government to get involved in the human resources issues of an independent agency.
