Desmond Swayne: What steps she is taking to increase employment opportunities for care leavers. 

Will Quince: This Government have introduced a £1,000 bursary for those starting an apprenticeship, the care leaver covenant and extended paid internship opportunities across the Government. I will build on the good work of my predecessor and meet employers to see how we can further improve job opportunities for care leavers.

Desmond Swayne: Of what does the Minister’s work with Barnardo’s consist?

Will Quince: I thank my right hon. Friend for that question. He is a passionate campaigner and supporter of Barnardo’s. The Department and Barnardo’s are developing a small work experience pilot for care leavers in a number of Barnardo’s high street shops. More broadly, the Government aim to use the care leaver covenant to secure 1,000 employment opportunities by September 2021.

Melanie Onn: Why is the youth obligation failing our young people so badly? More people on the youth obligation are falling out of benefits altogether. They are unable to maintain stability and are unable to go on to seek work.

Will Quince: I thank the hon. Lady for her question, but I gently point out that youth unemployment has halved under this Government.
