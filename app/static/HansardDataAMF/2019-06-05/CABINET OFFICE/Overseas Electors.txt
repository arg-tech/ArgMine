Sir David Amess: What plans he has to change the 15 year time limit on participation by overseas electors in UK elections. 

Kevin Foster: The Government are committed to scrapping the arbitrary 15 year rule. We were disappointed that the Overseas Electors Bill from my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) did not succeed, but we remain committed to implementing votes for life and are considering the next steps to deliver that.

Sir David Amess: Is my hon. Friend aware that not everyone is enthusiastic about these changes, starting with me? Even though it would affect two of my daughters, who live permanently in America, I cannot for the life  of me understand the justification for these changes. Will he also comment on reciprocal arrangements for non nationals voting here?

Kevin Foster: I thank my hon. Friend for his question, but I have to disagree with him. I am clear that we need to take the choice that is right for this country and our citizens who live abroad, many of whom have literally fought for this country and still retain very strong emotional connections to it and an interest in its affairs. That is why the Governmentâ€™s view is that the 15 year limit is arbitrary and should be removed.
