Stephen Hepburn: What recent steps he has taken to tackle fuel poverty in the north east. 

Chris Skidmore: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Claire Perry) has taken temporary ministerial leave of absence on compassionate grounds, I shall be answering all the questions relating to energy and clean growth today.The Government made a manifesto commitment to tackle fuel poverty by upgrading fuel poor homes to energy efficiency band C by 2030. Nearly 800,000 fewer fuel poor households are living in the least efficient homes than was the case in 2010. We have also refocused the Government’s energy company obligation, and thousands of homes in the north east have been improved as a result.

Stephen Hepburn: Because of cruel Tory benefit changes and rip off prices, fuel poverty in Jarrow has increased by 35% under this Government. Is the Minister proud of the choice that the Tories have given people, between heating and eating?

Chris Skidmore: It should be borne in mind that the fuel poverty metric is relative, which means that the number of people in fuel poverty will always fluctuate between 10% and 12%. It is important to focus on the average fuel poverty gap, which fell to £326 in 2016 from £341 in 2015.

Sarah Newton: rose—

John Bercow: Cornwall is a very considerable distance from the north east, but I think that the Minister just about broadened the question.

Sarah Newton: We have been making good progress in reducing fuel poverty in Cornwall, but we could really do with some help with supercharging that progress. When will the Government publish their plan to deliver the excellent home energy efficiency targets in the clean growth strategy? If we could do that, it would save people, on average, about £400 a year.

Chris Skidmore: I can confirm that that will be taking place very shortly.
