Philippa Whitford: What recent discussions he has had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on fiscal support for businesses in Scotland preparing for the UK leaving the EU. 

Greg Clark: The UK Government have provided the Scottish Government with almost £100 million to prepare for EU exit, alongside funding to support businesses with training and IT improvements. As we have heard in this question session, we have also supported businesses in Scotland through the city deals programme, including over £100 million for the Ayrshire growth deal in the hon. Lady’s constituency, which I know she welcomes.

Philippa Whitford: I do welcome that, but an Ernst & Young report shows that, although 74% of Scottish firms have taken steps to get ready for Brexit, only 8% feel fully prepared. As 30% of manufactured goods go to the EU, will the Secretary of State accept the Institute of Directors’ call for £750 million to provide a Brexit advice service for small firms?

Greg Clark: I work closely with the Institute of Directors and other business organisations to make sure that information is available to their members and others.  We will continue to do that over the months ahead, but it remains my ambition that we should have a deal that allows us to continue the successful trade that the hon. Lady mentions.

Ed Vaizey: Hear, hear! Well said.

John Bercow: Contain yourself, man. I am always grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for the provision of the voice of Wantage.
