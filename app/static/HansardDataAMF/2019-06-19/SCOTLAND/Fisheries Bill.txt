Alistair Carmichael: What recent discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the Fisheries Bill. 

David Mundell: I continue to work closely with colleagues on the Fisheries Bill, which will allow us to manage our fisheries sustainably and deliver on our promise to take back control of our waters. It will allow us to decide who may fish in our waters and on what terms as we become an independent coastal state.

Alistair Carmichael: The last time that I asked the Secretary of State about the Fisheries Bill, he deflected the question by saying that“we will see what happens when the Bill returns on Report.”—[Official Report, 16 January 2019; Vol. 652, c. 1152.]That was five months ago, and we have still not had the Fisheries Bill on Report. When are we going to get it?

David Mundell: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear me say that it will be in due course.
