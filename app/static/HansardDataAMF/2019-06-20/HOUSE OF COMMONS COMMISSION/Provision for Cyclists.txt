Rachael Maskell: What assessment the Commission has made of the adequacy of provision for cyclists on the parliamentary estate. 

Tom Brake: Parliamentary authorities continue to review the use of bicycle spaces to ensure that demand is met.

Rachael Maskell: Like many colleagues, I cycle to the parliamentary estate and I have to say that the parking facilities are woeful. If we are going to achieve a modal shift to encourage more employees of the House, as well as Members of Parliament, to cycle to this place, it is absolutely vital that we have adequate parking facilities. Will the right hon. Gentleman meet me and others to explore how that can be achieved?

Tom Brake: I am very happy to do so. I am a cyclist myself, and I must say that the facilities within Parliament are perhaps not quite what they should be, certainly given the lack of covered parking provision for cycles, so I would be very happy to meet the hon. Lady. I should point out that access to the parliamentary estate for cyclists has been improved, but I agree that there is a need to look at not just current provision, but provision under the northern estate programme and, at a future date, the restoration and renewal of the Palace.

Helen Goodman: roseâ€”

John Bercow: Order. We have not reached the hon. Lady yet. She is ahead of herself.
