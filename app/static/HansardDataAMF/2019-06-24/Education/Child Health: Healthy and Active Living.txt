Theresa Villiers: What guidance the Government issue to schools to encourage healthy and active living among children and young people. 

Nick Gibb: The school food standards define how schools should provide healthy food and drink throughout the school day. Guidance is available for primary schools on how to use the Â£320 million PE and sport premium. We are also making health education compulsory, which will focus on healthy active living and mental wellbeing.

Theresa Villiers: Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is crucial that we set achievable targets? In that regard, will he praise the golden kilometre initiative from the Mayor of Barnet to get children and young people running or walking for at least a kilometre a day?

Nick Gibb: I congratulate the mayor on the golden kilometre challenge, which is a very welcome initiative. I believe that every primary school should adopt either the golden kilometre challenge or the non metric and slightly longer daily mile. Regular exercise is clearly linked to long term health, which is why the new health curriculum guidance emphasises its importance.
