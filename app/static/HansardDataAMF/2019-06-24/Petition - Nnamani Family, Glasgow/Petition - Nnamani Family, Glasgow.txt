David Linden: I rise to present a petition from the ever compassionate constituents of Glasgow East who have joined in solidarity with the Church of Our Lady and St George in Penilee.The petition states:The petition of Glasgow East,Declares that Mary Nnamani and her family who fled from Nigeria in danger of their lives have become a full and valued part of our community in Glasgow through our schools and Church Community; further that the Nnamani family have claimed asylum here and we would dearly love them to say.The petitioners, therefore, request that the House of Commons urges the Home Office to grant Mary Nnamani and her family the right to remain in this country, where they have claimed asylum.And the petitioners remain, etc.[P002474]
