Laura Pidcock: I have a petition from residents in North West Durham, who are hoping that the Government listen.The petition states:The petition of residents of North West Durham,Declares that a succession of Government funding reductions has led to fewer services being delivered at Shotley Bridge Hospital; and further that this reduction of services threatens the viability of a community hospital in the Consett Area.The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to ensure there is no reduction of local NHS Hospital services in the Consett area.And the petitioners remain, etc.[P002482]
