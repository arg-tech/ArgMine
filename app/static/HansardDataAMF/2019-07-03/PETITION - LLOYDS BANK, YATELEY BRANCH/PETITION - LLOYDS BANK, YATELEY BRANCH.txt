Ranil Jayawardena: I rise to present a petition regarding the proposed closure of the Lloyds Bank branch in Yateley on 29 August, which is particularly highly valued by residents, especially older residents, people with disabilities and small business owners. The petition has been signed by nearly 1,000 people   already, with many signatures still coming in. I thank all those who signed, shared and promoted the petition, and this shows the strength of feeling in the community.The petition states:The Humble Petition of residents of the United Kingdom,Sheweth,That Lloyds Bank have proposals to close their Yateley branch on 29 August 2019; further that this high street branch is particularly highly valued, especially by older residents and small business owners who often pop in to manage their finances; further that there has been an increase of branch usage in the last year by businesses, proving the demand for a high street branch; and further that if accounts are moved to Camberley or Fleet, this becomes between a one  and two hour journey by public transport, which is clearly not in the best interests of our community.Wherefore your Petitioners pray that your Honourable House urges HM Government to take all possible steps to urge Lloyds Bank to reconsider this decision and to make sure that the banking industry considers the social implications of their actions.And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c.[P002485]
