Emma Hardy: I am sure that you, Mr Speaker, will share my deep regret over the decision by TransPennine Express to close the gate to Hull Paragon station, which has had   a detrimental impact on the disabled people living in Hull and the surrounding area because the gate is right outside the drop off point for people who are disabled. We have tried to talk to TransPennine Express to discuss the issue with the gate, but so far it appears to be unmoved, so I am hoping that this petition will move it towards doing the right thing.The petitioners“urge the House of Commons to put pressure on the government to work with First TransPennine Express and provide unrestricted access to the only pick up and drop off point…at Hull Paragon Station, by leaving the Anlaby Road gate open throughout the day.”Special thanks go to Tracy Dearing for collecting the signatures.Following is the full text of the petition:[The petition of Residents of the United Kingdom,Declares that it is wrong to restrict access to the only pick up and drop off point at Hull Paragon Station, by closing the Anlaby Road gates throughout the day; notes that for many disabled people, this is the only accessible route into the station (access to only disabled car parking spaces); further notes that First TransPennine’s suggestion that people should call a mobile number and wait to be admitted will result in (a) disabled people being left vulnerable while waiting to be admitted, (b) longer journey and waiting times and (c) disabled people being treated differently to able bodied people and calls on First TransPennine to provide unrestricted access to this point.The petitioners therefore urge the House of Commons to put pressure on the government to work with First TransPennine Express and provide unrestricted access to the only pick up and drop off point and disabled car parking spaces at Hull Paragon Station, by leaving the Anlaby Road gate open throughout the day.And the petitioners remain, etc.][P002489]
