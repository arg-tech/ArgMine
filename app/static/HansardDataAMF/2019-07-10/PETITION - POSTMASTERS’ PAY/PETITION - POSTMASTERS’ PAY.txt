Phil Wilson: This is a petition on behalf of the 375 residents of Chilton in my constituency, who are concerned about the future of the local post office. It is an issue that affects not only Chilton but the rest of the post office network, and it is to do with the payments made to sub postmasters which on occasions can lead to them being paid less than the minimum wage.The petition states:The petition of Residents of Chilton,Declares that no postmaster should be paid below the minimum wage; further that a related petition on this matter has received significant local support.The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to call on the Post Office Ltd to review postmastersâ€™ pay to prevent postmasters being paid below the minimum wage.And the petitioners remain, etc.[P002490]
