Patricia Gibson: What recent assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of the Court of Appealâ€™s ruling on the process of granting licences for the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. 

Liam Fox: We disagree with the judgment and are seeking permission to appeal. Alongside this we are considering the implications of the judgment for decision making. While we do this, we will not issue any new licences for exports to Saudi Arabia or its coalition partners which might be used in Yemen.

Patricia Gibson: Given the evidence from organisations such as the Red Cross, and given what we know about the humanitarian violations in Yemen, does the Secretary of State not think it is time, once and for all and  regardless of any review, to look at the international evidence, and stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia to break international law?

Liam Fox: We take a rigorous and robust view in this country, as the court said, and we are very aware of any potential breaches of international humanitarian law. I think the hon. Lady will find that the United Kingdom has one of the most stringent sets of rules around arms exporting anywhere in the world.
