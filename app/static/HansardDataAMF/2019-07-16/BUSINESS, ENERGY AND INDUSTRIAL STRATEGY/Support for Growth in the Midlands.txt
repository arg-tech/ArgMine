Jack Brereton: What recent steps he has taken to support growth in the midlands. 

Jake Berry: We are supporting the midlands engine through the £250 million midlands engine investment fund and £1.6 billion of local growth funding. I congratulate the west midlands, which recently published its local industrial strategy. I feel certain that this will ensure jobs and growth for many decades to come.

Jack Brereton: The ceramic valley enterprise zone in Stoke on Trent has been incredibly successful for our local economy by creating jobs. Will the Minister support continuing the ceramic valley enterprise zone and expanding it to include other sites in the city?

Jake Berry: Having had the privilege of visiting the ceramic valley enterprise zone during a recent visit to Stoke on Trent, I am delighted to confirm that, once completed, it will have created over 7,000 jobs and redeveloped 140 hectares of former brownfield land. I hope to continue to work with my hon. Friend, who  is a redoubtable campaigner for his constituency, to see what more can be done to expand this hugely successful site.
