David Linden: What recent discussions he has had with Transport for London on the effect of the roll out of the London low emission zone on showpeople who drive heavy goods vehicles. 

Michael Ellis: Transport in London is devolved to the Mayor of London and is delivered by Transport for London. Ministers and officials meet TfL regularly to discuss a range of topics. I have not discussed the effect of the roll out of the London low emission zone on showpeople who drive heavy goods vehicles.

David Linden: I am sure that the Minister is aware that under section 62 of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, showpeople have a number of exemptions and concessions. There is a possibility that showpeople could get an exemption from low emission zones in recognition of their lifestyle and businesses. Will the Minister encourage Transport for London to look favourably at that and make sure that we are supporting these people?

Michael Ellis: Yes I will. The hon. Gentleman alludes to the fact that Transport for London has agreed a 100% exemption for some showpeople using adapted vehicles from both the ultra low emission and low emission zones. The detail of that is up to the Mayor of London, not the Government, but I understand that the Mayorâ€™s office is agreeing a meeting with the hon. Gentleman to discuss the matter, and I wish him well in that.
