Karen Lee: What recent estimate he has made of the number of NHS workforce vacancies. 

Matthew Hancock: Question 10 is about workforce vacancies, and I can tell the House that one workforce vacancy has just been filled, because Boris Johnson has just been elected as the leader of the Conservative party.The NHS employs more staff now than at any time in its 70 year history, with significant growth in newly qualified staff from 2012. Our full people plan will help to tackle these issues for the long term.

Karen Lee: Words are all well and good, but it is actions that actually count, and the Government are not creating a health service that supports its workforce. The striking health visitors in Lincolnshire have each lost more than Â£2,000 a year since they were transferred from the NHS to the Conservative controlled county council and many have had their professional status downgraded. Does the Secretary of State agree that rather than shifting the responsibility for cuts to health services on to local government, the NHS should deliver fully resourced healthcare services and pay its staff properly?

Matthew Hancock: The NHS is delivering healthcare services and it is paying its staff properly. It is working with local authorities to deliver the best possible health services right across the country. We absolutely need to recruit more people to the NHS and we are recruiting more people to the NHS.
