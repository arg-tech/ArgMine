Dawn Butler: The petitioners, including the change.org online petitioners—almost 12,000 people in just a few days—call on the Prime Minister, who has 24 hours to rescue her legacy, to resolve the outstanding Windrush cases. There is still time to right the wrongs of Windrush. The Prime Minister can stop the dehumanisation and humiliation of the hostile environment. We call on the Prime Minister to declare an amnesty and ensure that all who entered as British citizens and came to the motherland to help rebuild her after the war have their British citizenship reinstated.The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May), and the Government to resolve all outstanding Windrush cases by Wednesday 24 July.Following is the full text of the petition:[The petition of Residents of the United Kingdom,Declares that the Prime Minister has spoken at great length recently about her legacy; further that if she leaves office before resolving the Windrush scandal and the many outstanding cases, then this will be her legacy; further that the Prime Minister should offer more than warm words and take action to solve the crisis she created; further that in 1948, individuals throughout the British Empire received citizenship under the British Nationality Act; further that these citizens, some from the Caribbean, came to the United Kingdom in order to help rebuild the country after the war; further that these citizens lived here, worked here and raised families here; further that the hostile environment policy accelerated during Mrs May’s time as Home Secretary led to many of these citizens losing their rights and in some cases being deported back to the Caribbean; further that others lost jobs, were forced into debt and suffer from immense stress and fear because of the policy; further that the former Home Secretary Amber Rudd said in April 2018 that it would only take two weeks to resolve the Windrush cases, however over a year has passed and there is still a significant number of outstanding cases; further that what has been done to these British citizens is outrageous, unfair and must end; further that a change.org petition initiated by Dawn Butler MP on this matter has received over 9,600 signatures.The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Prime Minister Theresa May and the Government to resolve all outstanding Windrush cases by Wednesday 24th of July.And the petitioners remain, etc.][P002502]
