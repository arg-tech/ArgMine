Douglas Chapman: The second petition has been signed by over 160 petitioners from my constituency. They are very concerned that the Department for Transport, through its agency the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, has been trying to diminish the opportunity for learner drivers to have their driving test carried out in their own community through the driving test centre in Dunfermline. Travelling elsewhere to be tested would add time and a huge cost for many younger drivers, their parents and driving school instructors alike. I have been keen to support the campaign as Dunfermline has a growing population and we should be securing as many key services that would be commensurate with a vibrant, growing town.The petition states:The petition of Residents of Dunfermline & West Fife,Declares that there is a clear demand for a Driving Test Centre to remain in Dunfermline.The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges Her Majestyâ€™s Government to work with the DVSA to ensure a long term arrangement is secured to retain the Driving Test Centre in Dunfermline with an adequate level of service provision to meet current and future demand.And the petitioners remain, etc.[P002504]
