Martin Whitfield: What recent discussions he has had with the Prime Minister on the devolution of further powers to Scotland. 

David Mundell: I have regular meetings with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, who has been unwavering in her passionate support for our Union. We have regularly discussed the UK Governmentâ€™s continued commitment to the devolution settlement and to a strong Scotland within a strong United Kingdom.

Martin Whitfield: If the Secretary of State is in his place later, what will he do to keep Scotland in its place in the UK?

David Mundell: I will continue to do as I have done for the past four and a bit years, and that is relentlessly to make the positive case for the benefit of Scotland being in the United Kingdom and to the United Kingdom of having Scotland in it.

David Davies: Britain will be leaving the European Union on 31 October, under our excellent new Prime Minister. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that, when we do  so, 100 extra powers will be devolved to the Scottish  Parliament, meaning that Conservatives and Brexiteers are the true friends of devolution and a strong Scottish Parliament?

David Mundell: My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. This party and this Government have been committed to the devolution settlement and to making it work. There is one party in this Parliament that would destroy devolution, and that is the SNP.
