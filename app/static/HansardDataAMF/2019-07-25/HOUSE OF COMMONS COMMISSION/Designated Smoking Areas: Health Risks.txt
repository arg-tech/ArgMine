Rachael Maskell: What recent assessment the Commission has made of the health risks of having designated smoking areas on the parliamentary estate.

Tom Brake: The Administration Committee considers proposals for  the provision of smoking areas. I can inform the hon.  Member that, for instance, on 11 March it endorsed a proposal to close the smoking area outside the Woolsack bar towards the House of Lords end of the estate, and she may want to write to the Committee if she has concerns or proposals on this issue.

Rachael Maskell: Can we ensure that all designated smoking areas are risk assessed—particularly the area between Portcullis House and Norman Shaw South, which is a major thoroughfare—not least because they are workplaces but also to ensure that we do the best for people’s health?

Tom Brake: I can confirm that the House authorities have identified and assessed several designated smoking areas, but I will draw to their attention the smoking area that the hon. Lady has referred to, because Members will know that when crossing from Portcullis to Norman Shaw, there is a little bit of passive smoking for those of us who are not smokers.
