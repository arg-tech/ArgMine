Lindsay Hoyle: I want to make a quick statement to remind Members who may not be aware that, when a Member visits another Member’s constituency, except on a purely private visit, they should take reasonable steps in advance to tell the Member in whose constituency the visit is taking place. The guidance also states that“failing to do so is regarded by colleagues as very discourteous.”I have had examples from both sides of the House. I just want to remind everybody that we ought to ensure that we give notice.
