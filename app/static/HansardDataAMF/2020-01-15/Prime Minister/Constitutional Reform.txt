Desmond Swayne: What plans he has to reform the relationship between the legislature, Executive and the judiciary.

Boris Johnson: A constitution, democracy and rights commission will be established to examine the broader aspects of the constitution and to develop proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates. Careful consideration is needed on the composition and focus of the commission, and further announcements will be made in due course.

Desmond Swayne: Will my right hon. Friend let bygones be top priority?

Boris Johnson: I can tell my right hon. Friend that our independent courts and legal system are admired around the world. We will continue to ensure that judicial review is available to protect the rights of individuals against an overbearing state while ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays.
