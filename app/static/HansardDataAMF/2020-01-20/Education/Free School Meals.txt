Sharon Hodgson: What his policy is on free school meals. 

Michelle Donelan: Free school meals play an important role in ensuring that disadvantaged children receive a healthy nutritious meal every school day. I assure the hon. Member and the House that the Government are committed to the provision of free school meals for children from homes that are disadvantaged on low incomes—it is of the utmost importance.

Sharon Hodgson: I thank the Minister for stating the Government’s policy on free school meals and getting that on the record. Given how beneficial free school meals are for reducing inequalities and improving children’s health and attainment, will she mirror Labour policy and extend free school meals to all primary school children?

Michelle Donelan: We already provide free school meals to 1.3 million children and 1.4 million infants. This policy is targeted at the most disadvantaged, which  we personally believe is right, as it ensures that they have the very best start in life and a nutritious meal every school day.
