Bridget Phillipson: What assessment he has made of the adequacy of funding for schools. 

Gavin Williamson: We are investing more in schools over the next three years, with an additional £2.6 billion in 2020 21, £4.8 billion in 2021 22 and £7.1 billion in 2022 23, when compared with 2019 20. That money will allow schools to invest more in teachers and resources to ensure that all children get the top quality education they deserve.

Bridget Phillipson: Every secondary school in my constituency has been judged by Ofsted to require improvement. We have seen various Government initiatives come and go, but when will the Secretary of State get to grips with the scale of the challenge at secondary level right across the north and bring forward a far more ambitious and properly funded plan to tackle it?

Gavin Williamson: It is troubling that the hon. Lady’s constituency has such a large number of schools that are not achieving at a good or outstanding level. We recently launched an educational multi academy trust in the north east known as the Falcon Trust to take over some of the most difficult and challenging schools and to instil in them the type of leadership and ability that can turn them around. The Government will look to expand and grow that much more rapidly, because no community should suffer from not having good or outstanding schools. We will not rest until we ensure that we do everything we can to deliver for children in schools in her constituency and many others.
