John Lamont: What recent steps she has taken to support businesses in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk constituency. 

Nadhim Zahawi: The Government are committed to spreading prosperity to all parts of the United Kingdom. We are investing £565 million through the borderlands growth deal and the Edinburgh and south east Scotland city region deal, demonstrating our commitment to supporting growth and prosperity in the Scottish borders.

John Lamont: The Minister will know about the borders’ fine, famous tradition of producing Scottish textiles, but this industry is being hammered by the US EU trade war, whereby many businesses face a 25% tariff on their exports to the United States. What are the Government doing to support those businesses and, in particular, compensate them for these tariff charges?

Nadhim Zahawi: Scottish textiles are, as my hon. Friend rightly points out, an important part of the Scottish economy, our overall economy and our heritage. We will do everything we can to protect this micro economy. The Government are working closely with the EU and the United States to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus Boeing dispute, and the Secretary of State continues to raise this personally with the United States Administration and is meeting the Trade Secretary later today.
