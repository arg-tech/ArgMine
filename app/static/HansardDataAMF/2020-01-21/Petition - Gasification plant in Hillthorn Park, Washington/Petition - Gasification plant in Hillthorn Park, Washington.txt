Sharon Hodgson: I am pleased to be able to present this petition this evening on behalf of my constituents who oppose the building of a gasification plant in Hillthorn Park in my constituency. The petitioners and I believe that this planning application will be to the detriment of our local area and the health and wellbeing of residents and is in direct conflict with the Governmentâ€™s own policies on waste and the environment. This petition is along the same lines as two other petitions that have been signed by approximately 10,800 people.The petition I present today reads:The Petition of residents of Washington and Sunderland West constituency,Declares that the petitioners oppose the building of a Gasification plant in Hillthorn Park, Washington. The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to recognise the opposition to the planning application; and calls on the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government to reject the planning application 17/02085/MW4.And the petitioners remain, etc. [P002551]
