Marion Fellows: What recent discussions she has had with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on increasing the level of employment for people with disabilities. 

Mims Davies: This Government are committed to reducing the disability employment gap and seeing a million more disabled people in work by 2027. We help disabled people to start, stay in and return to work through programmes including the Work and Health programme, a new intensive personalised employment support programme, Access to Work and Disability Confident.

Marion Fellows: Inclusion Scotland recommends that the Access to Work fund should be increased and the cap lifted, and Leonard Cheshire recommends a cut in application waiting times so as not to jeopardise job offers. Will the Minister agree to put these proposals to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and meet me to further discuss what concrete steps can be taken to reduce the disability employment gap?

Mims Davies: The Access to Work programme is a demand led scheme that helps disabled people to get advice and a discretionary grant of up to Â£59,000 per annum. It is a flexible in work support programme, and it will deliver reasonable adjustments, working with employers. I am sure that Ministers will be happy to hear from the hon. Lady.
