Jack Brereton: What recent assessment he has made of the value of trade between Scotland and the rest of the UK. 

Alister Jack: Scottish exports to the rest of the UK increased in 2018 by £1.2 billion to £51.2 billion. The official Scottish Government figures show that more than 60% of all Scotland’s trade is with England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. As a result, the rest of the UK continues to be Scotland’s largest market for exports, accounting for three times the value of exports to EU countries.

Jack Brereton: When it comes to trade, does my right hon. Friend agree that in these challenging times, regions across the country, from my constituency of Stock on Trent South all the way to the Scottish highlands, are stronger and more secure working together as a strong Union?

Alister Jack: My hon. Friend will not be surprised to hear that I do agree with him. I emphasise that Scotland does more than three times the trade with England, Northern Ireland and Wales as it does with the EU27 countries.
