Clive Efford: What steps he is taking to ensure that businesses do not profiteer from shortages of personal protective equipment in the health and social care sector. 

Nadhim Zahawi: Profiteering in PPE is completely unacceptable, and I want to be clear that no one should seek to exploit this health emergency for financial gain.

Clive Efford: That is a disappointing answer. The problem has been exacerbated by the Governmentâ€™s failure to stockpile PPE. There are numerous examples of people exploiting this situation, so it will only get worse if the Government do not act quickly. Will the Minister commit to legislating to take power to act against operators who exploit the situation?

Nadhim Zahawi: The Competition and Markets Authority has already written to the small number of firms suspected of profiteering, and the Secretary of State has recently met business and consumer representatives to discuss what further action might be necessary to address the issue. I have to put on record that the vast majority of firms are acting responsibly. So many across the UK, such as BrewDog, Diageo and hundreds of small operators, are supporting the national effort to tackle covid 19. As I said, the Secretary of State always keeps the options open for tackling profiteering.
