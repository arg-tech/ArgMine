Virginia Crosbie: What steps he is taking to ensure that there is a co ordinated response to the covid 19 outbreak with the devolved Administrations. 

Chloe Smith: We have established a Cabinet Committee structure to deal with the health, economic, public sector and international aspects of the covid 19 outbreak on behalf of the whole of the UK. Ministers from the devolved Administrations are regularly invited to participate in those discussions, and do so, in order to ensure the highest level of co ordination and effective working to tackle this crisis on a UK wide basis.

Virginia Crosbie: I thank the Minister for her response. Can she assure me that the level of co operation will continue to ensure that north Wales and Ynys MÃ´n are equipped with enough PPE provision for our struggling care homes and vital testing centres? Can she also assure me that there will be a UK wide approach to the easing of restrictions, and an app of the five tests?

Chloe Smith: I hope I can give my hon. Friend such reassurance. I am particularly grateful to the devolved Administrations, and in this case the Welsh Government, for their co operation, and we will continue to work with them in responding to the pandemic. That is in the interests of all our citizens. We respect the competence of the devolved Administrations in issues such as health and, where appropriate, we will seek a four nations approach.
