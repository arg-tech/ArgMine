Adam Afriyie: What steps he is taking with Cabinet colleagues to prevent false information on covid 19 spreading online. 

Chloe Smith: Misleading information about coronavirus, whether it is maliciously intended or not, could cost lives. The work to tackle false information is led by our colleagues in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport across all of Government. We are also working closely with social media platforms to help them to remove dangerous incorrect claims about the virus and promoting steps that everyone can take to reduce the spread of false information.

Adam Afriyie: [Inaudible.]

Lindsay Hoyle: We will move on. I call Minister Mercer who is going to take a question tabled by James Sunderland.
