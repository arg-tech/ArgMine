Pauline Latham: What steps his Department is taking with UK manufacturers to increase the supply of ventilators to the NHS. 

Michael Gove: My Department and the Department of Health and Social Care have been working with a variety of UK manufacturers in order to increase the supply of ventilators to the NHS. We have placed an order with one in particular, Penlon, for 15,000 additional ventilators. I am pleased to see so  many UK manufacturers and medical supply companies working so well together to ensure that we can increase domestic supply.

Pauline Latham: Will my right hon. Friend tell the House how many companies have risen to the challenge to make the extra ventilators neededâ€”companies that do not normally make them such as Dyson or Rolls Royce?

Michael Gove: Yes, of course. We have been working with 11 new potential, or existing potential, suppliers, but more than 5,000 businesses have been involved, offering to provide services, because, of course, when producing a complex machine such as a ventilator, we need to make sure that we source everything from the appropriate batteries, the appropriate valves and the appropriate other technology. As I say, 5,000 businesses, including Rolls Royce, have been involved in the manufacture.
