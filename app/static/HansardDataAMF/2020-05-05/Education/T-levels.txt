Steve Double: What assessment he has made of the potential effect of the introduction of T levels on the (a) quality and (b) recognition of technical education.

Gillian Keegan: T levels are based on the best international examples of technical education and, crucially, they are employer designed. They will help to raise the quality and prestige of technical education across the UK, with longer teaching hours and a meaningful industry placement. I am confident that they will provide a high quality alternative to A levels, giving technical education the status and recognition that it deserves.

Steve Double: I thank the Minister for that answer. It is clear that T levels will have a valuable part to play in ensuring that we have the workforce of the future across the economy, but the sector of the economy that is being most adversely affected by the current crisis is hospitality, and it is vital that that sector is able to access the workforce that it will need to recover, particularly in a post Brexit world, so will the Minister please consider bringing forward a T level in hospitality as soon as possible?

Gillian Keegan: I agree with my hon. Friend: equipping people with the skills that they need is crucial to our economic recovery, particularly in St Austell and Newquay. To support tourism and hospitality, which are important to his constituency, we will offer T levels in cultural heritage and visitor attractions, catering, and management and administration. I hope that, with my hon. Friendâ€™s support, T levels will be available soon so that young people in St Austell and Newquay can benefit from a high quality technical education.
