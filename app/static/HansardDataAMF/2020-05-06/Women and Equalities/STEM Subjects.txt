Dean Russell: What recent assessment she has made of the trends in the level of uptake of STEM subjects by girls. 

Elizabeth Truss: Since 2010, there has been a 31% increase in girls’ entries to science, technology, engineering and maths A levels in England, and a 34% increase in the number of women accepted on to full time STEM undergraduate courses in the UK. Increasing the number of women in STEM industries is vital for our country’s economic success and also for equality of opportunity.

Dean Russell: In Watford we have incredible, inspirational women and girls across the area. Watford girls school, for example, does incredible work in this space. How are we are supporting women, including those who are learning at school at the moment, into STEM roles, so that we can continue to showcase how Britain is playing a leading global role in science for all?

Elizabeth Truss: I thank my hon. Friend for his question. It is still the case that women make up only 25% of those employed in manufacturing and 30% of those in information technology. We need more women in those fields to use their amazing talents. We are committed to removing the barriers to success for women and to celebrating those who have achieved, such as Ruth Amos of StairSteady, who has invented new areas of engineering, which we should continue to celebrate.
