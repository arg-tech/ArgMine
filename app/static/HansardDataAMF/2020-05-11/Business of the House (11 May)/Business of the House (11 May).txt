Nospeaker: Motion made,That—(1) The following arrangements shall apply to today’s business:(2) At the conclusion of each debate, the Speaker shall put the Question on each of the motions on the Order Paper relating to the business listed in the table for that debate.—(Maria Caulfield.)The Speaker declared the Question to be agreed to (Order (4), 22 April).

Lindsay Hoyle: As the Leader of the House announced in the business statement, the main debate today will continue tomorrow. As the motion just agreed to requires me to put the Question at the end of the debate, I can announce that my determination is that there will be no Division on the Question today. I expect to put the Question today and for it to be negated on the voices. A motion in the same terms will be moved formally when the debate resumes tomorrow, but it will be a single debate for all other purposes.I call the right hon. Member for Chelsea and Fulham (Greg Hands) to make a personal statement.
