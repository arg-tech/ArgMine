Karin Smyth: What steps she has taken to help ensure prompt payment of access to work costs during the covid 19 outbreak. 

Justin Tomlinson: The access to work support has prioritised payments, including those to key workers, and where possible is making payments the same day. Key worker and new employee applications are being cleared urgently. Additionally, I am pleased to announce access to work recipients can now email claim forms as a reasonable adjustment.

Karin Smyth: On 4 May, the Secretary of State assured the House that the Government would provide an automatic extension of PIP awards that are due to expire during the coronavirus virus pandemic. Can the Minister confirm that this extension applies to all claimants, including those who received an award following an appeal?

Justin Tomlinson: Obviously, PIP is different from access to work. There was an issue for those on fixed term, short awards, but we have now addressed that, and those claimants will continue to get an automatic six monthsâ€™ extension if it is due in the next three months.
