Claire Coutinho: What steps her Department plans to take to support employment after the covid 19 outbreak. 

Mims Davies: Thank you, Mr Speaker. We have launched two key new websites, “Job help” and “Employer help”, to provide additional information tools and links to the DWP’s “Find a job” website, which has approximately 1.7 million users signed up and over  145,000 public and private sector employers registered. The DWP is currently considering a wide range of options on how best to support people back into work.

Claire Coutinho: I commend Ministers and civil servants for the tremendous work they have done to get millions of people on boarded over the last few weeks. What steps are being taken to get self employed people, in particular, back on their feet in the next stage?

Mims Davies: I thank my hon. Friend for that question. We have temporarily relaxed the minimum income floor to allow self employed claimants to access UC at a more generous rate. Meanwhile, the Treasury’s self employment income support scheme online service is available from 13 May, and the DWP is providing mentoring and business support through our new enterprise allowance programme. As the economy restarts, we will continue to keep under review how we can best support all of this cohort.
