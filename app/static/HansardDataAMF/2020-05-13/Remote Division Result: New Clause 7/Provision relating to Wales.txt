Nospeaker: Amendments made: 20, page 60, line 28, after “modify” insert“any of the following legislation so far as it has effect in relation to Wales”.This Amendment and Amendment 21 remove the limitations on the purposes for which the Welsh Ministers may modify the legislation listed. The changes mean that the powers of the Welsh Ministers, in relation to Wales, are the same as those of the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland, in relation to Northern Ireland.Amendment 21, page 60, line 32, leave out sub paragraph (2).See the explanatory statement for Amendment 20.Amendment 22, page 61, line 15, leave out“negative resolution procedure (unless section 47(5) applies)”and insert “affirmative resolution procedure”.—(Victoria Prentis.)As the effect of Amendment 21 is to broaden the powers of the Welsh Ministers, this amendment provides for an exercise of the power to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.

Eleanor Laing: As the next Question is contingent on the outcome of the remote Division that has just concluded, but the result of which we do not yet have, I have to suspend the House for a short time—about five minutes—while the report of the Division on amendment 39 is prepared.Sitting suspended.
