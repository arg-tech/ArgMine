Munira Wilson: What recent discussions his Department has had with representatives of British Airways on its planned restructuring. 

Kelly Tolhurst: The Department and I are working with airlines, airports and unions to understand the full impact that covid 19 is having on the sector and its workers.

Munira Wilson: Many of my constituents are long serving members of British Airways staff, yet they face redundancy or being stripped of their terms and conditions, despite BA furloughing some 23,000 staff. Does the Minister think that is responsible behaviour by Britainâ€™s flag carrier? What pressure is she bringing to bear on the company? Will she guarantee that any bail out will come with stringent and binding conditions on reducing carbon emissions?

Kelly Tolhurst: I understand that it is a worrying time for airline staff and their families. I have been speaking regularly with companies across the sector to encourage them to draw down on the unprecedented support package. Terms and conditions of employment are for negotiation between the employee and the employer, but we in the Department stand ready to support any workers affected.
