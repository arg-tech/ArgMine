Edward Leigh: What recent discussions his Department has had with LNER on a direct rail service between Grimsby and London. 

Andrew Stephenson: Recent analysis by LNER indicates that such a service could be viable and the Department is exploring this further.

Lindsay Hoyle: We now go, with audio only, to Sir Edward.

Edward Leigh: Mr Speaker, I am sorry that you do not have a picture because the broadband in rural Lincolnshire is so bad. That is why it is even more important that we get our through train from Grimsby  and Cleethorpes down to London, which we have been promised again and again. It is a huge catchment area. All the Government have to do is to kick start this project. Given that they are spending £100 billion on HS2, if they just give us £1 million, LNER will give us the through train. Will the Government fulfil their promises and kick start the through train to London from Grimsby and Cleethorpes?

Andrew Stephenson: My right hon. Friend has lobbied me on this several times already. I know that the rail Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton Harris), is looking very closely at what my right hon. Friend says, and hopefully he may have some good news in due course.
