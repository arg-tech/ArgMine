Amy Callaghan: What discussions he has had with Cabinet colleagues on the future of the UK aviation sector. 

Kelly Tolhurst: We are working across Government and closely with the sector on establishing a clear vision and objectives for the recovery of the sector.

Amy Callaghan: The day prior to the announcement of BA CityFlyer redundancies at Edinburgh airport, Willie Walsh gave evidence to the Transport Committee in which he did not mention that once. It is inconceivable that he was not aware of the announcement. Does the Minister share my frustration that that lack of transparency simply prevents Parliament from performing effective scrutiny?

Kelly Tolhurst: The aviation sector is so important for the UK economy, which is why it has been able to draw down on an unprecedented support package. The Department and I have set up a restart and recovery unit to work with industry, including unions, ground handlers, airlines and airports, in order to come up strong measures to aid the recovery and restart of the aviation sector.
