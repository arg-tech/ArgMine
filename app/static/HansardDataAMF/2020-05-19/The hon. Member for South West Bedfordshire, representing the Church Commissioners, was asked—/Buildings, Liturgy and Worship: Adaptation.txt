Fiona Bruce: What representations the Church of England has received on the adaptation of its buildings, liturgy and worship prior to their reopening after the covid 19 lockdown. 

Andrew Selous: The House of Bishops guidance issued on 5 May shows that the Church of England is committed to reopening buildings in a phased and measured manner, in accordance with the legal position. We are working with the Government and representatives of the heritage planning sector to assess the need for building adaptations related to public health.

Fiona Bruce: Polling shows that during the current crisis, one in four adults, and one in three of 16 to 30 year olds, have joined a religious service remotely. Does my hon. Friend welcome that, and what is the Church doing to ensure that this continues more widely, even after lockdown?

Andrew Selous: I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing those figures to the Houseâ€™s attention and I welcome them very warmly, particularly the large viewing figures among younger people. She is absolutely right that the Church will need to keep up a significant online presence well after lockdown has finished.
